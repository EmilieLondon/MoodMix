## Acknowledgements üåü

First and foremost, we would like to thank our taste buds. Without their constant craving for delicious cocktails and mouth-watering meals, MoodMix wouldn't exist.

We would also like to thank the internet, for providing endless inspiration in the form of quotes from famous people. And a special shoutout to the frontend web development community, for making the impossible possible with their wizardry skills.

Next, we would like to acknowledge the power of teamwork. Without our fantastic team of developers, MoodMix would be nothing but a pipe dream.

Thank you Andrew, Dane üíõ ............we can add people here as we go, who make a difference, we can also change this up

Last but not least, we want to thank our users. You are the reason we do what we do. So sit back, grab a drink, and let MoodMix elevate your mood ........ this is something I thought of including, it's obvs the best app out there hah
